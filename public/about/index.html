<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about these principles, I encourage you to visit his site and check him out. They, along with others, serve as motivators for this page.</p>
<p>This is not a tech-page, nor a personal development page. It&rsquo;s nothing, but for me it was a thought and I ended up taking action - that&rsquo;s the first motivation.</p>
<p>I currently can think of so many positive effect of doing this, that it motivates me to continue. Whenever I reach the moment, where I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll consider pulling the brake, do a pitstop, and maybe jump back in and continue the ride.</p>
<p>By creating this website and sharing the journey, I hope to encourage others to be curious, share their experiences, continuously develop, and explore.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thank you for stopping by.</p>
