<p>In his video he discusses the complexities of performing null checks in C# and how the language&rsquo;s evolution has introduced overlapping and sometimes conflicting methods for handling null references.</p>

<h3 id="traditional-null-checks">Traditional Null Checks</h3>
<p>Traditionally (until C# 6), null checks in C# were done using <code>user == null</code> and the opposite using <code>user != null</code></p>
<p>The issue with the equal / not equal operators is that it can be overloaded.</p>
<h3 id="the-is-operator">The <em>is</em> operator</h3>
<p>Starting from C# 6 the <em>is</em>-operator was introduced, allowing for null checks like this this: <code>user is null</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach checks the reference directly and cannot be overloaded, making it a more reliable way to check for null.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I am no expert, but as I write this post I honestly can&rsquo;t come up with a scenario where one would want to override the <em>==</em> operator&hellip;)</p>
<h3 id="the-not-operator">The <em>not</em> operator</h3>
<p>From C# 9 the <em>not</em>-operator was introduced, which allows us to check if something <em>is not</em> null  like this: <code>user is not null</code></p>
<p>This <em>new</em> syntax aligns more closely with how I presume developers typically read <code>user == null</code> as <code>user is null</code> anyway and thus I think the <em>new</em> approach is</p>
<p>However, Nick emphasizes that this newer approach doesn&rsquo;t apply to Unity developers, who checks if something exists rather than checking for an actual null reference. This distinction adds to the complexity and potential confusion.</p>
<p>Bonustip from his own comment on the video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And for those wondering, both null-coalescing operators (??= and ??) and the ?. operator will be compiled to the &ldquo;is null&rdquo; version if the compiler detects that the operator is overloaded</p>
