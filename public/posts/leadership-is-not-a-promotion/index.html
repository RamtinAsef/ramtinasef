<p>For the past six months, I’ve had the privilege of working as a <em>Chapter Lead</em>. I say &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a role I truly enjoy for many reasons, but I&rsquo;ll get to that later.</p>
<p>Interestingly, several people have congratulated me on being promoted to a leadership role. Promoted. Every time, I correct them: I haven’t been promoted. I’ve simply started on a different <em>path</em>. So, what does that mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look at my team, you’ll notice I’m managing a group of developers who are much more skilled in coding than I am. Some of them are probably better managers too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the key: none of them (at least right now) want to take on a management role. Not because they can&rsquo;t—they’re incredibly talented—but because they don’t want to walk that <em>path</em>, at least not yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often seen situations where the best developer on a team is promoted to engineering manager, and it doesn’t always turn out well. It happens a lot, unfortunately, and in my opinion, it’s not always the best strategy.</p>
<h3 id="leadership-requires-a-different-skill-set">Leadership Requires a Different Skill Set</h3>
<p>A manager leads a team, not because they were the best at their previous role, but because they bring specific skills that align with leadership. What are those skills? Just like there are many skills on the developer path, there are many in the leadership path as well.</p>
<p>One of the most important, in my experience, is the ability to care—to genuinely want the best for the team. And to do that, you also have to care about each individual on the team, while keeping the overall success of the team as your focus.</p>
<p>Being a good leader also requires transparency, strong communication, and empathy. A great leader knows how to listen, read people, and understand what they need to thrive. There’s a long list of qualities, but in the end, it boils down to someone who wants to lead for the right reasons—not just as a step on the corporate ladder.</p>
<h3 id="my-path-as-a-leader">My Path as a Leader</h3>
<p>This might sound like a rant, but it’s not. I’m not claiming to know the definitive traits of a great manager—only what I’ve observed and believe makes for good leadership. <strong>I&rsquo;m not an expert</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I’m still on this path. I’m learning continuously, making mistakes, and growing from them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal is to become <em>the</em> leader that my team needs, adapting to the unique individuals and challenges we face together.</p>
</blockquote>
