      <description>I recently saw a youtube video of Steven Hazels talk from the Nerd Nite Austin #160 where he talked about deleting code and why it is important.&#xA;In his 18 minute talk he drops a few tactics on how to get it done.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll simplify it by dividing it into 3 topics.&#xA;Letting Go of Commented Code If any commented code exists in the code, if often times is better to remove it.</description>

      <description>Many of us in the tech industry have a deep-rooted passion for coding, problem-solving, and staying at the cutting edge of technology. So, when the opportunity arises to step into a leadership role, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to feel a twinge of apprehension. One common concern – which I also had - is the fear of losing touch with technical skills while focusing on managerial responsibilities. However, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to recognize that this fear may be unfounded.</description>

      <description>I started reading &amp;lsquo;Unit Testing&amp;rsquo; by Vladimir Khorikov and as I go through it, I would like to pick some of the topics he goes through and write them down. I believe this helps me understand the subject better.&#xA;In the first chapter, he discusses the importance of coverage metrics. Most of us have seem them and experienced a project where a specific code coverage was required.&#xA;During my studies we had a course about testing code, where we also went by different coverage metrics.</description>

      <description>The Case You unpacked your stuff, opened the programs, got a quick overview of the daily tasks and then you start coding - hopefully you get &amp;ldquo;into the zone&amp;rdquo;. You know, the period where you are just doing things fast and well.&#xA;Suddenly a Teams-notification pops up. It&amp;rsquo;s Roger from the other team who sent you the message &amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo;. Nothing else.&#xA;Well, he&amp;rsquo;ll probably sent another message, so you wait. 10 seconds later, Roger hasn&amp;rsquo;t sent another message.</description>
