				<p>I&rsquo;ve started reading Continous Delivery by Jez Humble and David Farley (aka Dave Farley). And a way for me to better remember things I dive into is to write them down. This forces me to have an at least minimum understanding of what I&rsquo;ve done or else I won&rsquo;t be able to write it properly down.</p>
<p>But why <em>that</em> book? The why is always important. In this case a good colleague of mine had recommended the book. The colleague has a <em>very</em> high level of technical skills and when someone highly skilled within a specific domain recommends something within that domain then I honestly tend to listen more. It&rsquo;s also a domain that I work with and where I have a lot of things to learn, thus it&rsquo;s a 99% win.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dive into who Dave Farley or Jez Humble are for now, but from now purely stick to the books chapter one.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<p>The authors really try to lay the foundation for the book by explaining the importance of Continous Delivery (CD) in modern software development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book describes an effective pattern for getting software from development to release</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They emphasize that this process for many is tense, stressful since it has a lot of risks associated with the process <em>that makes release a scary time</em>.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t yet have a huge experience in the tech-industry, but I&rsquo;ve already witnesses situations, where we were that - stressed, tense and worried about the risks following a release.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also been on the other side. I&rsquo;m actually there right now. In a situation where we don&rsquo;t fear deployments to Production or <em>Prod</em> as we call it. And why is that? I&rsquo;ll dig into that later, but I can already tell that it&rsquo;s definitely by <em>trying</em> to follow many of the steps that is mentioned in this chapter.</p>
<p>So what do the authors touch on in this chapter?</p>
<p>They expain some of the common release antipatterns - and I admit I&rsquo;ve done them all.</p>
<h3 id="antipattern-deploying-software-manually">Antipattern: Deploying Software Manually</h3>
<p>Who haven&rsquo;t tried that? And in a <em>professional</em> setup? I have. Many times. I&rsquo;ve tried following a very long tutorial guide on how to do a deployment, following specific steps, then after the deployment of Service A, another manual process had to be done for Service B - asap!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen situations where only very few people knew how to deploy - even in a big organization that only 1 (ONE!) person could deploy - which that person did manually - from his own laptop&hellip;</p>
<p>And again, let me remind you that I don&rsquo;t have a long track record as a developer.</p>
<p>As we know with so many other things, manual processes have a risk of error.</p>
<p>In the book some signs of this antipattern is mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The production of extensive, detailed documentation that describes the
steps to be taken and the ways in which the steps may go wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliance on manual testing to confirm that the application is running
correctly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There should be two tasks for a human being to perform to deploy software into a development, test, or production environment: to pick the version and environment and to press the “deploy” button</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick Chapsas has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oeMTz7LwrU" title="Nick Chapsas null check">a YouTube video</a> where he talks us through the &lsquo;right way&rsquo; of checking for null in C#.</p>
<p>In his video he discusses the complexities of performing null checks in C# and how the language&rsquo;s evolution has introduced overlapping and sometimes conflicting methods for handling null references.</p>
<p>Nick explains that while C# is a robust language, its age and the addition of new features without altering existing behaviors have created a confusing landscape for null checking.</p>
<h3 id="traditional-null-checks">Traditional Null Checks</h3>
<p>Traditionally (until C# 6), null checks in C# were done using <code>user == null</code> and the opposite using <code>user != null</code></p>
<p>The issue with the equal / not equal operators is that it can be overloaded.</p>
<h3 id="the-is-operator">The <em>is</em> operator</h3>
<p>Starting from C# 6 the <em>is</em>-operator was introduced, allowing for null checks like this this: <code>user is null</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach checks the reference directly and cannot be overloaded, making it a more reliable way to check for null.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I am no expert, but as I write this post I honestly can&rsquo;t come up with a scenario where one would want to override the <em>==</em> operator&hellip;)</p>
<h3 id="the-not-operator">The <em>not</em> operator</h3>
<p>From C# 9 the <em>not</em>-operator was introduced, which allows us to check if something <em>is not</em> null  like this: <code>user is not null</code></p>
<p>This <em>new</em> syntax aligns more closely with how I presume developers typically read <code>user == null</code> as <code>user is null</code> anyway and thus I think the <em>new</em> approach is</p>
<p>However, Nick emphasizes that this newer approach doesn&rsquo;t apply to Unity developers, who checks if something exists rather than checking for an actual null reference. This distinction adds to the complexity and potential confusion.</p>
<p>Bonustip from his own comment on the video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And for those wondering, both null-coalescing operators (??= and ??) and the ?. operator will be compiled to the &ldquo;is null&rdquo; version if the compiler detects that the operator is overloaded</p>
