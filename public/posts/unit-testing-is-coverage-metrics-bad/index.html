<p>In the first chapter, he discusses the importance of <em>coverage metrics</em>. Most of us have seem them and experienced a project where a specific code coverage was <em>required</em>.</p>
<p>During my studies we had a course about testing code, where we also went by different coverage metrics. In one of our assignments, I remember there was a requirement for a quite high code coverage percentage, and I think we all experienced - even on such a small project as the ones we do during studies - that coverage metric requirements can be a pain to work with.</p>
<p>I think I can also speak for everyone when I say that we all experiences having our focus the wrong place - naimly on the coverage metric and not on the <em>quality</em> of the tests themselves. That&rsquo;s one of many of the points Vladimir has regarding the risks of using coverage metrics in his book.</p>
<p>So, what is coverage metrics?</p>
<p>Coverage metrics refer to the measurement of how much of the source code is exercised by automated tests or as Vladimir states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A coverage metric shows how much source code a test suite executes, from none to 100%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different types of coverage metrics, but some of the well-known ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line coverage (<em>or &ldquo;code coverage&rdquo; as Vladimir calls it</em>)</li>
<li>Branch coverage</li>
<li>Function coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dive into the different types but rather what to be aware of.</p>
<p>I like the phrase Vladimir uses and try to always have it in the back of my head when seeing coverage metrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>coverage metrics are a good negative indicator, but a bad positive one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can easily have 100% code coverage without even <em>really</em> testing anything - just use a lot of assertion-free testing as the example mentioned in his book. And even though the intentions with the use of code coverage metrics are good, a required high percentage code coverage metric can conflict with deadlines, costs, etc, resulting in people trying to do a workaround just to reach the metric.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the metrics, focus on the quality, what matters and costs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost component is determined by the amount of time spent on various activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring the test when you refactor the underlying code</li>
<li>Running the test on each code change</li>
<li>Dealing with false alarms raised by test</li>
<li>Spending time reading the test you&rsquo;re trying to understand how the underlying code behaves</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
