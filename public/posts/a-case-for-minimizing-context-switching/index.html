<p>You unpacked your stuff, opened the programs, got a quick overview of the daily tasks and then you start coding - hopefully you get <em>&ldquo;into the zone&rdquo;</em>. You know, the period where you are just doing things fast and well.</p>
<p>Suddenly a Teams-notification pops up. It&rsquo;s Roger from the other team who sent you the message &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;. Nothing else.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;ll probably sent another message, so you wait. 10 seconds later, Roger hasn&rsquo;t sent another message.
30 seconds later. Still nothing. Damnit, Roger. You end up replying to Roger &ldquo;Hello Roger, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A minute later Roger sends a follow up question. Not important. But you answer politely. You actually end up telling Roger, that you could have a 30-minute meeting about it at 12:30.</p>
<p>Roger agrees and sends you an invite to a Teams-meeting, which you accept.</p>
<p>From Roger sent you the &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;-message until now, it took only 6 minutes. That&rsquo;s not much.
So, back to coding. Hmm, what was it you were looking at? Oh, yeah something about setting up a service. Ah, yes <em>that</em> service. You start coding. But wasn&rsquo;t there something about <em>that</em> service? Hmm.. Think&hellip; Ah, yes, now you remember and after a while you are back <em>&ldquo;in the zone&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Not bad, is it?</p>
<h3 id="the-math">The Math</h3>
<p>Yes, it is bad. You just got interrupted and did a context switch.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dive into that in detail now, but according to this article from 2005:</p>
<p><a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/CHI2005.pdf/" title="No task lef behind? Examining the Nature of Fragmeneted Work">No task left behind? Examining the Nature of Fragmeneted Work</a></p>
<p>a context switch <em>costs</em> up to 25 minutes in productivity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you have a &ldquo;Roger-experience&rdquo; two times a day. Just two times.</p>
<p>(6 minutes for the communication back and forth + 25 minutes for context switching) * 2 pr. day = 62 minutes pr. day.</p>
<p>62 minutes pr. day * 5 days pr. week = 310 minutes pr. week (or approx. 5 hours pr. week).</p>
<p>5 hours pr. week equals 20 hours pr. month (assuming there is 4 weeks pr. month).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 20 hours pr. month lost in productivity.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s theoretical, and there rightfully pops a lot of &ldquo;but hey..&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t..&rdquo; sort of sayings, but nevertheless, try to focus on prioritize your <em>focus time</em> and consider what you can do to keep the number of context switches as low as possible. There are a lot of good strategies, which you can implement on a personal level, but also on what can be done a team-level.</p>
<p>By the way, I once got replied &ldquo;nohello.com&rdquo; after sending &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to someone at work. The reply was meant as a joke, but still with some learning behind it. I ended up visiting the site and since then I&rsquo;ve never just sent a &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; or something like that. Check it out: <a href="https://nohello.com/" title="nohello.com">nohello.com</a></p>
