## About

Greatly inspired by Scott Hanselman, I appreciate the ideology of "owning things" - not only building and being curious about them but also engaging in the before, during, and after processes.

Another valuable ideology Scott emphasizes is considering the number of keystrokes you have left and using them wisely.

If you're curious about these principles, I encourage you to visit his site and check him out. They, along with others, serve as motivators for this page.

This is not a tech-page, nor a personal development page. It's nothing, but for me it was a thought and I ended up taking action - that's the first motivation.

I currently can think of so many positive effect of doing this, that it motivates me to continue. Whenever I reach the moment, where I can't, I'll consider pulling the brake, do a pitstop, and maybe jump back in and continue the ride.

By creating this website and sharing the journey, I hope to encourage others to be curious, share their experiences, continuously develop, and explore.

Nevertheless, thank you for stopping by.
