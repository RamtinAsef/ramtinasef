Many of us in the tech industry have a deep-rooted passion for coding, problem-solving, and staying at the cutting edge of technology. So, when the opportunity arises to step into a leadership role, it's natural to feel a twinge of apprehension. One common concern – which I also had - is the fear of losing touch with technical skills while focusing on managerial responsibilities. However, it's crucial to recognize that this fear may be unfounded.

At least that’s one of the things David Neal dives a bit into during his GREAT talk “Leadership Guide for the Reluctant Leader” at the DevTernity Conference in 2021. (A talk I would definitely recommend to watch).

Taking cues from seasoned leaders and industry experts, it becomes evident that embracing leadership doesn't mean abandoning technical skills. Instead, it's akin to learning to ride a bike – a skill that, once acquired, remains with you, ready to be picked up again whenever needed. While the focus may shift towards honing managerial skills, the underlying technical acumen remains a valuable asset.

David Neal, in his insightful talk, emphasizes the importance of seeking support and mentorship when transitioning into a leadership role. He suggests viewing leadership as an opportunity for growth and learning, much like our ongoing journey in mastering technical complexities. Just as we invest time and effort in staying updated with the latest coding languages or frameworks, dedicating resources to developing leadership competencies can be equally rewarding.

An essential aspect of effective leadership lies in empowering others to reach their full potential (as emphasized by Simon Sinek). Just as we derive satisfaction from solving complex coding challenges, guiding and mentoring team members towards success can be immensely fulfilling. Leadership isn't solely about managing tasks; it's about fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement – qualities deeply ingrained in the tech community.

Moreover, leadership roles offer avenues for exploring new facets of the industry, such as project management, stakeholder engagement, and strategic planning. These experiences not only broaden our skill set but also provide valuable insights into the holistic functioning of organizations, enhancing our effectiveness as tech professionals. 
And I really believe that everyone can become a leader, so if you’ve been thinking about taking the leap, but had the FOMO on technical skills, I hope the above helped you onto considerations.

In essence, the fear of losing technical skills should not deter aspiring leaders from embracing new opportunities. Instead, it should serve as a catalyst for personal and professional growth. By adopting a growth mindset, seeking guidance from mentors, and investing in leadership development, individuals can navigate the transition with confidence and resilience.

So, the next time you contemplate stepping into a leadership role, remember – it's not about leaving technical skills behind; it's about embarking on a journey of continuous learning, adaptation, and empowerment. Just like riding a bike, leadership is a skill that can be mastered and refined over time, enriching both your career and the broader tech community.
