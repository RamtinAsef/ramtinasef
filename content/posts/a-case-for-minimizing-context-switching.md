### The Case

You unpacked your stuff, opened the programs, got a quick overview of the daily tasks and then you start coding - hopefully you get _"into the zone"_. You know, the period where you are just doing things fast and well. 

Suddenly a Teams-notification pops up. It's Roger from the other team who sent you the message "Hello". Nothing else.

Well, he'll probably sent another message, so you wait. 10 seconds later, Roger hasn't sent another message.
30 seconds later. Still nothing. Damnit, Roger. You end up replying to Roger "Hello Roger, what's up?".

A minute later Roger sends a follow up question. Not important. But you answer politely. You actually end up telling Roger, that you could have a 30-minute meeting about it at 12:30.

Roger agrees and sends you an invite to a Teams-meeting, which you accept.

From Roger sent you the "Hello"-message until now, it took only 6 minutes. That's not much.
So, back to coding. Hmm, what was it you were looking at? Oh, yeah something about setting up a service. Ah, yes _that_ service. You start coding. But wasn't there something about _that_ service? Hmm.. Think... Ah, yes, now you remember and after a while you are back _"in the zone"_.

Not bad, is it?

### The Math

Yes, it is bad. You just got interrupted and did a context switch.

I won't dive into that in detail now, but according to this article from 2005: 

[No task left behind? Examining the Nature of Fragmeneted Work](https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/CHI2005.pdf/ "No task lef behind? Examining the Nature of Fragmeneted Work")

a context switch _costs_ up to 25 minutes in productivity.

Let's say that you have a "Roger-experience" two times a day. Just two times.

(6 minutes for the communication back and forth + 25 minutes for context switching) * 2 pr. day = 62 minutes pr. day.

62 minutes pr. day * 5 days pr. week = 310 minutes pr. week (or approx. 5 hours pr. week).

5 hours pr. week equals 20 hours pr. month (assuming there is 4 weeks pr. month).

That's 20 hours pr. month lost in productivity.

I know it's theoretical, and there rightfully pops a lot of "but hey.." and "I don't.." sort of sayings, but nevertheless, try to focus on prioritize your _focus time_ and consider what you can do to keep the number of context switches as low as possible. There are a lot of good strategies, which you can implement on a personal level, but also on what can be done a team-level.
