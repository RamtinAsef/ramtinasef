So recently, I uploaded my first post with the title 'My First Post.' Not only that, I had my static site running, had a repository backing it up and a ci/cd setup up. 

All in all, it took me only approximately 30 minutes, following a 10-minute YouTube tutorial on how to set up my own static site using:

* Github
    * Repository
    * GitHub Pages
* Hugo
* Git

There are tons of tutorials on YouTube. The one I followed was from *JustAGuy Linux* called *Building a custom site with Hugo on GitHub*.

Link: [Building a custom site with Hugo on GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1O-8zhPQmU "Building a custom site with Hugo on GitHub").

I haven't dived into Hugo yet, but I'll definitely do that. The main reason is to learn more about static sites, the language, the process behind the curtains and maybe create my own template in the future.

I'll also post a deep dive later on into why I chose this approach instead of maybe building a dynamic site from scratch. Both ways are doable, but for now, for my setup / intent a static site is definitely the go-to.

But the main point here is that this only took me 30 minutes, following a 10-minute YouTube video. So if your excuse is 'time', then I guess it isn't valid anymore.

By the way - naturally I would like to automate as much as possible. Therefore I will also dive into how I can automate this process, and on the go post some of the steps I automate and how, making the time-factor less relevant and the transition *from thought to action* more relevant.
