I'm actually excited about this post - to see what my thoughts will be in 5 years from now. But here goes:

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), LLM, buzzwords and trends come and go with remarkable speed. 
One such trend that has captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and AI aficionados is the concept of "prompt engineering." It's been hailed as a game-changer, a career path, a revolution in fine-tuning AI models, and even dubbed the secret sauce behind creative AI outputs. 
But as the buzz around prompt engineering grows louder, it begs the question: 

### _Is prompt engineering the new "thing"_

.. or is it yet another overhyped development in the AI world?

Courses are being sold (not cheap btw), "How To Become A Prompt Engineer"-articles are being published and posts like "The Top {X} Prompts You Should Know Right Now!" is being seeing everywhere on LinkedIn.

But is it _really_ a thing? Will it ever be?

In my humble honest opinion, it's not and it won't be, and here's why:

I think that prompt engineering can be somehow related to "Learn How To 'Google'" or _requirement specifications_. As time passes by, we all get better at it. And I honestly believe that the with time, users will become better at creating effective prompts, but also that AI engines will become better at interpreting them, reducing the need for prompt engineers.

The _"Fear Of Missing Out"_ is what enables people and companies to sell these courses, and I can empathize with the other side, the people buying them (FOMO and lack of resources), since the AI train is moving at an astonishing pace. You wouldn't want to be the person or company left far behind.

Let's wait and see. Perhaps, in three to five years, I'll look back and realize I was mistaken. But as of now, I don't see it happening.
